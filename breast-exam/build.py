"""
Purpose: Build the breast clinical skills page (breast-exam/index.html) from the manoeuvre
         tables in the medwiki note "Summary Notes - Breast Clinical Skills".
Author: Noor Simsam
Date: 2026-10-28
Input: the vault note (POM2_VAULT or the default vault path); img/credits.json; clips.json
       (Health Education Media Library draping video); the Geeky Medics videos are set in EXAM.other_video
Output: breast-exam/index.html

The note is the single source of the steps and positive findings: edit the note,
then rerun this script. Which problem heading each manoeuvre sits under, and its
picture, are set here. How the page looks lives in clinical-skills/exam_page.py,
shared by every exam page. The drawn palpation diagrams come from make_diagrams.py.
