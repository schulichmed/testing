"""
Purpose: Build the vital signs and general inspection clinical skills page (vitals-exam/index.html)
         from the medwiki note "Summary Notes - Vital Signs Clinical Skills".
Author: Noor Simsam
Date: 2026-10-28
Input: the vault note (POM2_VAULT or the default vault path); img/credits.json; clips.json
       (Health Education Media Library clips); videos.json (Geeky Medics)
Output: vitals-exam/index.html

The note is the single source of the steps and positive findings: edit the note, then rerun this
script. Problem headings and pictures are set here; how the page looks lives in
clinical-skills/exam_page.py, shared by every exam page.
