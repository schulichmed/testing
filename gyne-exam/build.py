"""
Purpose: Build the pelvic (gynecological) and obstetrical abdominal clinical skills page
         (gyne-exam/index.html) from the manoeuvre tables in the medwiki note
         "Summary Notes - Pelvic Exam Clinical Skills".
Author: Noor Simsam
Date: 2026-10-28
Input: the vault note (POM2_VAULT or the default vault path); img/credits.json; videos.json
       (Geeky Medics); img/ holds Commons pictures and drawings from draw_figures.py
Output: gyne-exam/index.html

The note is the single source of the steps and positive findings: edit the note,
then rerun this script. Which problem heading each manoeuvre sits under, and its
picture, are set here. How the page looks lives in clinical-skills/exam_page.py,
shared by every exam page. No photographs of bodies: every picture is a drawing,
a diagram or an instrument.
