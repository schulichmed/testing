"""
Purpose: Build the respiratory clinical skills page (resp-exam/index.html) from the
         manoeuvre tables in the medwiki note "Summary Notes - Respiratory Clinical Skills".
Author: Noor Simsam
Date: 2026-10-28
Input: the vault note (POM2_VAULT or the default vault path); img/credits.json; clips.json
       (the Health Education Media Library's respiratory exam videos, by region or card)
Output: resp-exam/index.html

The note is the single source of the steps and positive findings: edit the note,
then rerun this script. Which problem heading each manoeuvre sits under, and its
picture, are set here. How the page looks lives in clinical-skills/exam_page.py,
shared by every exam page.
