"""
Purpose: Build the abdominal clinical skills page (abdo-exam/index.html) from the
         manoeuvre tables in the medwiki note "Summary Notes - Abdominal Clinical Skills".
Author: Noor Simsam
Date: 2026-10-28
Input: the vault note (POM2_VAULT or the default vault path); img/credits.json; clips.json
       (the Health Education Media Library's abdominal exam videos, by test, region or card);
       videos.json (Geeky Medics, the teaching channel); videos_other.json (other channels)
Output: abdo-exam/index.html

The note is the single source of the steps and positive findings: edit the note,
then rerun this script. Which problem heading each manoeuvre sits under, and its
picture, are set here. How the page looks lives in clinical-skills/exam_page.py,
shared by every exam page.
