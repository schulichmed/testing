"""
Purpose: Build the male genital and rectal clinical skills page (gu-exam/index.html) from the
         manoeuvre tables in the medwiki note "Summary Notes - Male Genital and Rectal Exam Clinical Skills".
Author: Noor Simsam
Date: 2026-10-28
Input: the vault note (POM2_VAULT or the default vault path); img/credits.json
Output: gu-exam/index.html

The note is the single source of the steps and positive findings: edit the note, then rerun this
script. Which problem heading each manoeuvre sits under, and its picture, are set here. How the
page looks lives in clinical-skills/exam_page.py, shared by every exam page. Every picture is a
drawn schematic: this is an intimate exam, so no photographs of bodies are used.
